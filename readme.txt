Displays files in a directory tree in groups of similar files.

== Description ==

This plugin is for displaying links to files in a directory tree.  Instead of using the directory tree for structure, the files displayed in groups.  Similar files are grouped together.

For the initial version, files considered similar if their file names start the same.  Regular expression matches and other criteria are planned for future versions.

TODO: describe shortcodes here.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `grouped_file_find.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory and unzip.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add shortcodes to list directories, like this: [groupfiles src="wp-content/charts" maxdepth="2"]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What did you build this for =

I had a directory structure containing charts in different keys.  I wanted to list them both by key (the directory structure) and grouped by piece (similar files)
